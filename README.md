- 👋 Hi, I’m @fitzyeris
- 👀 I’m interested in comp. sci, particulary UI design and problem solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/JS/CSS for application building within a node.js environment. Also bulking up my python and C skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects, app development, and more!
