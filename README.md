##### 👀 I love user design, website development, and animations with JavaScript and other languages. That's what'll mostly be here. 

##### 🌱 I’m currently learning functional programming in Python, some JavaScript, and bulking up on my problem solving skills through LeetCode

##### 💞️ AI projects, robotics, app development, and more are on the way!
